        A new company, Podsurfer, has decided to help people find new podcasts to listen to. By collecting and storing user-inputted podcast data, users can search for, favorite, rate, and review podcasts. You’ve been hired as a consultant to build out a web
        app for this project. The client wants your team to create a user-friendly web application for users to find and add podcast data. In addition, your team can enhance the application with other features at your discretion. Your objective is to
        allow users to add data to your podcast database, allow for searching on this data, and displaying the results and providing recommendations to the user.
